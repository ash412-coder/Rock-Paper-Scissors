How it works:
1. The computer randomly chooses between Rock, Paper, or Scissors using Python’s random library.
2. Then the player enters their choice.
3. After that program compares the two choices to decide who wins the round.
4. A scoreboard keeps track of wins, losses, and ties.
5. The game continues until the player types 'quit'.
